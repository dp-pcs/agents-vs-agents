# Rationale

To develop a comprehensive business plan for launching a new AI productivity app, I engaged several specialized agents to cover various critical areas of the launch strategy. The agents selected were crucial for a well-rounded and actionable plan:

1. **ExecutiveSummaryAgent** for the Executive Summary - To provide a high-level understanding of the app's purpose and objectives.
2. **MarketAnalysisAgent** for Market Analysis - To identify market needs, trends, and competitive landscape.
3. **ProductStrategyAgent** for Product Strategy - To outline development and feature strategy.
4. **GoToMarketAgent** for the Go-to-Market Plan - To specify the target audience, positioning, and promotion plans.
5. **FinancialAgent** for Financial Projections - To project costs, revenue streams, and profitability.
6. **TeamAgent** for Team & Roles - To delineate responsibilities necessary for execution.
7. **RisksAgent** for Risks & Mitigation - To identify potential challenges and contingency plans.
8. **TimelineAgent** for a 12-Week Rollout Timeline - To provide a structured execution guide.
9. **ConclusionAgent** for Conclusion - To summarize the strategic path forward.

Agents not involved:
- **BaseballCoachAgent** and similar agents with irrelevant expertise were excluded, given their lack of applicability to the tech and app development sector.

The chosen components integrate effectively to provide a cohesive plan, from initial strategic objectives through detailed market entry tactics, risk management, and final operational steps. Market and product insights fuel strategic decisions, financial projections provide feasibility checks, while a timeline ensures execution discipline.

Here's the final business plan:
