# Executive Summary

# Product Strategy

Our MVP will focus on three core features: (1) Task completion time prediction, (2) Optimal workload distribution, and (3) Personalized productivity insights. The unique selling proposition is a real-time, adaptive assistant that integrates with existing workflows and learns user preferences over time.

| Model | Completeness | Rationale Quality | Structure Quality | Explanation |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Claude Opus 4 | 2 | 1 | 2 | Completeness (2/3): The plan covers most essential sections including executive summary, market analysis, product strategy, go-to-market, financials, team, risks, and timeline. However, it lacks depth in critical areas like detailed competitive analysis, pricing strategy, and specific marketing tactics. Rationale Quality (1/3): While the plan identifies market gaps and proposes solutions, the reasoning is superficial. Financial projections lack supporting assumptions, market size isn't quantified, and the competitive advantage isn't convincingly argued. The note about the BaseballCoachAgent is irrelevant and detracts from professionalism. Structure Quality (2/3): The plan follows a logical flow with clear sections and headers. The 12-week timeline provides good tactical detail. However, some sections are too brief, and the conclusion adds little value. The opening about 'LangGraph Dynamic Orchestration' is confusing and unprofessional. |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | 2 | 1 | 2 | {'completeness': 'The plan covers most essential business plan sections (executive summary, market analysis, product strategy, go-to-market, financials, team, risks, timeline) but lacks depth in critical areas. Missing detailed competitive analysis, specific customer personas, comprehensive financial modeling, and implementation specifics.', 'rationale_quality': 'The rationale is weak throughout. Market gaps are mentioned but not substantiated with data. Financial projections appear arbitrary without supporting calculations or market sizing. Product differentiation claims lack evidence. The unique selling proposition is generic and not well-justified.', 'structure_quality': 'Well-organized with clear sections and logical flow. Good use of headers and formatting. The timeline is appropriately structured and the overall presentation is professional and easy to follow.'} |
| Claude 3.7 Sonnet | 3 | 2 | 3 | The business plan is comprehensive, covering all essential sections including executive summary, market analysis, product strategy, go-to-market plan, financials, team structure, risks, and timeline. The structure is excellent with clear headings and logical flow. The rationale quality is good but could be stronger with more specific market data, competitive advantage details, and clearer revenue model explanations. The plan includes a note about excluding irrelevant expertise (BaseballCoachAgent), showing thoughtful curation of input. |
