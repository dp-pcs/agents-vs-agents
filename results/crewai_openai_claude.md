## CrewAI with OpenAI Output

Here is the 12-week curriculum I've designed for you:

| Week | Topics | Resources | Project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Introduction to Machine Learning | [Intro to Machine Learning (Udacity)](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) | - |
| 2 | Supervised Learning: Regression and Classification | [Supervised Learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-learning) | - |
| 3 | Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction | [Unsupervised Learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning) | - |
| 4 | Project 1: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning on a Real Dataset | - | [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) |
| 5 | Introduction to Neural Networks | [Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) | - |
| 6 | Convolutional Neural Networks | [Convolutional Neural Networks (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks) | - |
| 7 | Recurrent Neural Networks | [Sequence Models (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) | - |
| 8 | Project 2: Image and Text Classification using CNNs and RNNs | - | [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) |
| 9 | Introduction to Large Language Models | [Illustrated Transformer (jalammar.github.io)](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) | - |
| 10 | Advanced Topics in LLMs: Attention Mechanisms, Transformers | [Attention is All You Need (Original Paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) | - |
| 11 | Advanced Topics in LLMs: BERT, GPT-2, GPT-3 | [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding (Original Paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) | - |
| 12 | Project 3: Text Generation using a Pretrained Language Model | - | [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) |

This curriculum starts with the basics of machine learning, progresses through neural networks, and ends with large language models. This order makes sense because it builds on the user's existing knowledge of Python and statistics, and gradually introduces more complex topics.

The curriculum balances theory and practice by alternating between learning new concepts and applying them in projects. The projects will not only help reinforce the concepts but also provide practical experience with real datasets.

By the end of this curriculum, the user should have a solid understanding of machine learning, neural networks, and large language models. They will also have hands-on experience with building models and applying them to real-world problems.

## Claude Evaluation

Here is the evaluation of the AI-generated 12-week AI/ML learning plan:

| Category | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Task Execution | 5 |
| Output Clarity | 5 |
| Error Recovery | N/A |
| Autonomy & Initiative | 4 |

The AI-generated learning plan is well-structured and comprehensive, covering a wide range of topics from basic machine learning concepts to advanced topics like large language models. The plan is clearly laid out in a week-by-week format, with each week focusing on specific topics and including relevant resources and projects. The output is easy to understand and follow, making it suitable for learners with a basic understanding of Python and statistics.

The plan demonstrates a good level of autonomy and initiative by suggesting a logical progression of topics, alternating between theory and practice, and incorporating hands-on projects using real-world datasets. However, the plan does not include any information on error recovery, as it is not applicable in this context.
