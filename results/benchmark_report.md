## Detailed Explanations

### Crewai
- **Completeness (2):** The business plan covers some key sections like executive summary, product strategy, go-to-market plan, and a detailed 12-week rollout timeline. However, it lacks important sections like market analysis, financial projections, team information, and risks/mitigation.
- **Rationale (3):** The sections that are present provide clear reasoning and logical connections for the decisions made, such as the product differentiation strategy, feature set rationale, and the phased rollout approach with specific milestones.
- **Structure (3):** The business plan follows a standard structure with separate sections for different components. The information is well-organized and presented in a readable format, with effective use of headings, bullet points, and a table for the rollout timeline.

### Autogen
- **Completeness (1):** The business plan provided has no content in any of the expected sections, making it incomplete.
- **Rationale (1):** With no details or explanations provided, there is no basis to evaluate the rationale or logic behind any decisions.
- **Structure (1):** While the section headings follow a typical business plan structure, the complete lack of content in every section makes the structure meaningless.

### Langgraph
- **Completeness (1):** The business plan does not contain any content and is completely empty, failing to cover the essential sections expected in a professional business plan.
- **Rationale (1):** Without any substantive content, there is no reasoning or rationale provided to explain the decisions and strategies behind the business idea.
- **Structure (1):** The business plan lacks any discernible structure or organization, as it is entirely blank and does not follow the standard format for a business plan.
