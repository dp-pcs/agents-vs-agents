**Summary:**

The curriculum starts with the basics of machine learning, gradually introducing more complex concepts such as neural networks and support vector machines. This order ensures that the learner has a solid foundation before moving on to more advanced topics.

The theory is balanced with practice through three hands-on projects. The first project involves implementing linear and logistic regression on a real dataset, allowing the learner to apply what they've learned in a practical setting. The second project involves building a neural network to classify images, which provides experience with more complex models. The final project involves fine-tuning a Transformer model on a text classification task, which gives the learner hands-on experience with large language models.

By the end of this curriculum, the learner should have a solid understanding of the core foundations of machine learning, including how large language models work. They should also have practical experience applying these concepts through hands-on projects.

## Claude Evaluation

Here is the evaluation of the AI-generated 12-week AI/ML learning plan:

| Category | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Task Execution | 5 |
| Output Clarity | 4 |
| Error Recovery | N/A |
| Autonomy & Initiative | N/A |

The AI-generated learning plan effectively breaks down a 12-week curriculum for learning AI and machine learning. The plan covers essential topics in a logical order, starting with the basics and gradually progressing to more advanced concepts. It incorporates a well-regarded online course and includes practical projects to reinforce learning. The output is clear and well-structured, making it easy to follow. However, the categories of Error Recovery and Autonomy & Initiative are not applicable in this context, as the output is a static learning plan and does not involve interactive error handling or autonomous decision-making.
