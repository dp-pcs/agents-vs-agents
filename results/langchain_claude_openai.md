The order allows the learner to develop a strong foundation in key ML techniques like data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Hands-on projects every few weeks enable the learner to practically apply concepts to real datasets.\n\nThe plan balances theory and practice by pairing conceptual courses with coding tutorials. Learners first gain the theoretical understanding of each topic, then reinforce it through hands-on implementation. Helpful resources are provided each week, including courses, articles, and tutorials.\n\nBy the end of 12 weeks, the learner should have a solid grasp of the core ML algorithms, evaluation techniques, and data processing. They will understand foundational deep learning architectures like CNNs and RNNs. The final weeks provide exposure to advanced NLP and transformer models.
