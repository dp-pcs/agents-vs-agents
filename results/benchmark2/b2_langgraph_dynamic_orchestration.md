2. **MarketAnalysisAgent**: To analyze the current market landscape, identify target segments, and assess competitive dynamics.
3. **ProductStrategyAgent**: To outline the vision, objectives, and unique features of the app, as well as the development roadmap.
4. **GoToMarketAgent**: To develop a strategy for launching the app, including marketing, partnerships, and sales tactics.
5. **FinancialAgent**: To project financial outcomes, including revenue streams, cost structures, and profitability.
6. **TeamAgent**: To define the roles and responsibilities necessary for successful app development and launch.
7. **RisksAgent**: To identify potential risks and propose mitigation strategies.

The different components fit together into a cohesive plan by addressing all critical aspects of the business launch, from market analysis and product strategy to financial projections and risk management. Each section builds upon the previous one, ensuring a well-rounded approach to entering the market and achieving business success.
