## Rationale

To create a comprehensive business plan for launching a new AI productivity app, I involved the following expert agents:

1. **Executive Summary Agent**: To provide a high-level overview of the plan and establish a context for what the app will address.
2. **Market Analysis Agent**: To understand the current landscape of AI productivity tools, identify competitors, and assess market needs.
3. **Product Strategy Agent**: To determine the unique features and development roadmaps for the AI app, ensuring it meets market demands.
4. **Go-to-Market Plan Agent**: To outline the strategies for how the app will be introduced to potential users and how early engagement will be built.
5. **Financial Projections Agent**: To construct realistic forecasts that influence how resources will be allocated.
6. **Team & Roles Agent**: To detail the composition and responsibilities of the team needed to execute the plan effectively.
7. **Risks & Mitigation Agent**: To identify potential risks and propose strategies to mitigate them, ensuring smooth implementation of the plan.
8. **12-Week Rollout Timeline Agent**: To provide a detailed timeline that maps out the steps for launching the app over three months.
9. **Conclusion Agent**: To summarize the plan and reaffirm the operational strategy.

The agents not employed include irrelevant specialties such as **BaseballCoachAgent**, since coaching in sports bears no relevance to the development or marketing of an AI productivity application.

Each component of this plan fits together to provide a coherent route from concept to market entry. The strategy begins with an understanding of the market, followed by a meticulous product definition, tactical market entry plans, resource allocation, team structure, and risk management, all tied into a precise timeline.
