| 12 | Deploying ML Models | [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/spring2021/lecture-7/) | Transformer Project |

Summary:
This 12-week plan starts with the fundamentals of machine learning, including key concepts, algorithms, and techniques. It then progresses to deep learning, starting with the basics of neural networks before moving on to more advanced architectures like CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers. 

The plan balances theory and practice by including hands-on projects every 3-4 weeks. These projects allow the user to apply what they've learned to real datasets and build practical skills.

The resources include a mix of online courses, tutorials, and articles from reputable sources. They are ordered to gradually increase in difficulty, ensuring the user has the necessary foundation before tackling advanced topics.

By the end of the 12 weeks, the user should have a solid understanding of the core concepts in machine learning and deep learning. They will know how to implement common algorithms, build and train neural networks, and work with state-of-the-art models like Transformers. They will also have practical experience from the projects and be ready to apply their skills to new problems.

## OpenAI Evaluation

| Category            | Score |
|---------------------|-------|
| Task Execution      | 5     |
| Output Clarity      | 5     |
| Error Recovery      | N/A   |
| Autonomy & Initiative | 5   |

The AI has executed the task perfectly by providing a comprehensive 12-week learning plan for AI and machine learning. The output is clear and easy to understand, with a well-structured table outlining the topics, resources, and projects for each week. There were no errors made in the output, hence there was no need for error recovery. The AI showed a high level of autonomy and initiative by not only listing the topics but also providing relevant resources and suggesting projects at regular intervals to reinforce learning. The summary paragraph is also well-written, providing an overview of the learning journey and the expected outcomes.
