# Rationale

For the launch of the new AI productivity app, "ProdAI," I decided to involve the following agents to create a comprehensive business plan:

1. **Executive Summary Agent**: To provide a concise overview of the business opportunity, product, market strategy, competitive advantage, and financial projections.
2. **Market Analysis Agent**: To analyze the industry landscape, target market, trends, competitive landscape, and market entry strategy.
3. **Product Strategy Agent**: To outline the vision, objectives, core features, user experience, technology, and innovation roadmap.
4. **Go-to-Market Plan Agent**: To detail the marketing, sales, distribution, and customer engagement strategies.
5. **Financial Projections Agent**: To forecast revenue, costs, profitability, and funding needs.
6. **Team & Roles Agent**: To define the team structure, roles, and responsibilities necessary for execution.
7. **Risks & Mitigation Agent**: To identify potential risks and strategies to mitigate them.
8. **12-Week Rollout Timeline Agent**: To provide a detailed timeline for launching the app.
9. **Conclusion Agent**: To summarize the overall business plan and invite stakeholders to join the initiative.

I chose not to involve irrelevant agents like the BaseballCoachAgent, as their expertise does not align with the business and technological focus of launching an AI productivity app.

The different components fit together into a cohesive plan by addressing all critical aspects of launching and scaling the app, from market analysis and product development to marketing strategies and financial planning. This integrated approach ensures that all elements are aligned towards achieving the business objectives and capturing a significant market share.
