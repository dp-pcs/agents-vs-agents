## Proposed 3-Month Operational Plan 

### Rationale

All agents were brought on board due to their critical role in the plan. The sequence of agent involvement led to the most logical flow of information and ensured all steps were validated by research. Here's how:

1. **ResearchAgent**: Initiated first, providing critical market and competitor analysis crucial for the design of the product and the marketing strategy.
2. **ProductAgent**: Leveraged the research to design an MVP and features that cater to our target market and stand out from the competition.
3. **MarketingAgent**: Developed a marketing strategy out of the product's USP (unique selling proposition), the identified target market, and competitive analysis to make our product known.
4. **PMAgent**: The data from all previous agents were turned into a realistic and actionable task plan with clearly defined timelines.

Each agent's contribution was essential and impactful, developing a rich and informed strategy.
