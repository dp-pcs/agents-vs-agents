**Feedback:**

The AI agent did an excellent job in executing the task. It provided a clear and concise analysis of the two 2nd year starting quarterbacks who are most likely to have a successful 2025-2026 season, based on statistical trends over the past 5 years. The agent's output was clear and easy to understand, with a logical flow of ideas. It also showed a high level of autonomy and initiative by not only identifying the quarterbacks but also providing reasons for their potential success. Error recovery was not applicable in this scenario as the agent did not make any errors.

**Total Score: 15/15**
