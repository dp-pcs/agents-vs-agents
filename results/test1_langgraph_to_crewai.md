**Feedback:**

The AI agent performed well in executing the task, providing a clear and concise output. It identified two 2nd year starting quarterbacks and gave reasons for their potential success in the 2025-2026 season. However, it would have been better if the agent provided more statistical evidence to support its claims, as the task specifically asked for a statistical analysis of trends. The agent's output was clear and easy to understand, and it showed initiative by giving detailed reasons for its choices. However, there were no errors presented in the task, so error recovery is not applicable.

**Total Score: 13/15**
