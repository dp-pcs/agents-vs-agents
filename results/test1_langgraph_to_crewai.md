**Feedback:**

The AI agent did a good job at identifying the two 2nd year starting quarterbacks most likely to have a successful 2025-2026 season based on the trends of the past 5 years. The output was clear, concise, and easy to understand. However, the agent could have provided more detailed statistical analysis to support its predictions, such as specific performance metrics or comparison with other quarterbacks. The agent showed initiative by providing reasons for its predictions, but could have been more autonomous by providing more comprehensive analysis.

**Total Score: 13/15**
