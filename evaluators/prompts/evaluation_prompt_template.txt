You are an AI educational coach. A user has asked for help designing a personalized learning plan to become proficient in AI and machine learning.

They already know:
- Python programming
- Basic statistics

They want to:
- Learn the core foundations of machine learning
- Understand how large language models work
- Build hands-on projects using real datasets

Constraints:
- The user has ~10 hours per week to learn
- The total plan should last 12 weeks

Your task:

1. Design a 12-week curriculum that builds progressively each week  
2. Include at least one hands-on project every 3–4 weeks  
3. Recommend specific courses, tutorials, or reading (include links if possible)  
4. Make sure the difficulty increases over time — don’t start with transformers  
5. Output the plan in a clear markdown table:
   - Week
   - Topics
   - Resources
   - Project (if applicable)
6. At the end, write a summary explaining:
   - Why this order makes sense
   - How it balances theory + practice
   - What the user should know by the end
